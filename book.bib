This paper contains evidence in support of a new 'configurational' paradigm in which a primary property of the form of the urban grid is to privilege certain spaces over others for through movement. In this way it is suggested that the configuration of the urban grid itself is the main generator of patterns of movement. Retail land uses are then located to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the passing trade and may well act as multipliers on the basic pattern of 'natural movement' generated by the grid configuration. The configurational correlates of movement patterns are found to be measures of global properties of the grid with the 'space syntax' measure of 'integration' consistently found to be the most important. This has clear implications for urban design suggesting that if we wish to design for well used urban space, then it is not the local properties of a space that are important in the main but its configurational relations to the larger urban system.},

So, space syntax measures are chosen as the principal theoretical postulates for analysis, because of its quantitative and scientific approach. In this paper, an attempt has been made to analyse the spatial structure of the street network in an Indian city \textendash{} Mysore \textendash{} by a comprehensive application of space syntax techniques. The study has been conducted by breaking down the structure into components and by analysing the use of different measures, like integration and choice, using Depthmap software (Turner, 2012). The analysis is then related to the existing mobility pattern and land-use to construe how the spatial structure influences the mobility pattern and land-use.},

We can then see clearly how a very few core nodes dominate this network, there are approximately 200 countries in the world but these 19 largest jurisdictions in terms of capital together are responsible for over 90\% of the assets. This type of  centralized structure to a network is surprisingly reverent in our world and we could cite many other examples of it, such as social networks where a very few people may have millions of people connected to them and the vast majority very few. These highly centralized networks are more formally called scale free or power law networks, that describe a power or exponential relationship between the degree of connectivity a node has and the frequency of its occurrence. These power law networks are really define by the mathematics that is behind them so lets just take a quick look at that it. In these networks, The number of nodes with degree x is proportional to 1 over x squared So, The number of nodes with degree 2 is one fourth of all the nodes The number of nodes with degree 3 is one ninth of the nodes The number of nodes with degree 10 is proportional to one hundredth If we have a network with a thousand nodes of degree one then we would have 250 nodes with degree two, and proximally 31 with degree ten. If we notice then when we go from degree one to degree two we had a very big drop, but then going from degree two to teen the drop is a lot more gradual and this decline continues to get more gradual giving the graph what is called a long tail. The point to take away from this is that this long tail means there can be nodes with a very high degree but there will also be very many with a very low degree of connectivity giving us our centralized network.  This type of power law graph was first discover within the degree distribution of websites on the internet with some websites like Google and Yahoo having very many links into them but there also being very many sites out on the web that have a very few links into them.  Since then it has been discovered in many types of very different networks such as in metabolic networks where the essential molecules of ATP and ADP that provide the energy to fuel cells play a central role interacting with a very many different molecules, where as most of the molecule interaction very few others, thus making these two molecule hubs in the metabolic networks fueling the cells in our bodies.

Transcription: When we hear the word network all sorts of things spring to mind like social networks and the Internet in particular, but the power of network theory is really in its high degree of abstraction, so the first thing for us to do is to try and start back at the beginning by forgetting what we think we know about networks and embrace the abstract language of networks what is called graph theory. In the formal language of mathematics a network is called a graph and graph theory is the area of mathematics that studies these objects called graphs. The first theory of graphs goes back to 1736, the first textbook came about in 1958 but most of the work within this field is less than a few decades old. In its essence a graph is really very simple, it consist of just two parts what are called vertices and edges. Firstly Vertices; a vertex or node is a thing, that is to say it is an entity and we can ascribe some value to it, so a person is an example of a node as is a car, planet, farm, city or molecule. All of these things have static properties that can be quantifies, such as the color of our car, the size of our farm, or the weight of our molecule. Within network science vertices are more often called nodes so we will be typically using this term during the course. Edges can be define as a relation of some sort between two or more nodes, this connection may be tangible as in the cables between computers on a network or the roads between cities within a national transportation system or these edges may by be intangible, such as social relations of friendship. Edges may be also called links, ties or relations and we will be often using this latter term during the course. The nodes belonging to an edge are called the ends, endpoints, or end vertices of the edge. Within graph theory networks are called graphs and a graph is define as a set of edges and a set vertices. A simple graph does not contain loops or multiple edges, but a multigraph is a graph with multiple edges between nodes. So where as a simple graph of a transpiration system would just tell us if there is a connection between two cities, a multigraph would show all the different connections between the two cities. Graphs can be directed or undirected. With an undirected graph edges have no orientation, for example a diplomatic relation between two nations may be mutual and thus have no direction to the edge between the nodes. These undirected graphs have unordered pairs of nodes, that means we can just switch them round, if Jane and Paul are married, we can say Jane is married to Paul or we can say Paul is married to Jane it makes no difference and thus it is an unordered pair.

Transcription excerpt: How something spreads across a network is a key question we will be interested in asking when analyzing many different networks, the classical example of this being the diffusion of a disease through some population, but we might be talking about how the loss of one species in an ecosystem has an effect on others, the spread of financial contagion from one institution to another, or the spread of some information within a group of people. More formally we call this spreading on a network propagation or diffusion, how diffusion happens and how long it takes is defined by a number of different parameters. We will just list the primary factors involved here before looking into them individually. Firstly we have some infectiousness metric, where we are talking about how infectious is the phenomena that is spreading on the network.  A corollary to this is asking how resistant are the nodes to this contagion giving us a resistance parameter.  Next we need to consider the topology to the network, obviously this diffusion is taking place along the connections within the network, meaning different structures to the connections and different degree distribution will be another defining factor when considering diffusion. Lastly we need to consider if this diffusion is taking place strategically or at random and this ties back to topology because as we have already discussed some network topologies are more susceptible to strategic influence then others. So Firstly to discuss infectiousness: By infectiousness we mean something that is likely to spread or influence others in a rapid manner, irrespective of the type of network it is spreading on. If you hear about some important piece of news, you feel driven to tell others and that is infectiousness, it is like an out word force that is pushing the phenomena across local connections and out over the network. We may be able to quantify this in terms of money or how contagious a disease is or a number of other metrics but we also need to ask, how many nodes a given node can infect in any given time interval? A mosquito can only bit one other creature at a time but a person can broadcast a message to possibly millions of other people at any given instance, thus enabling a much more rapid contagion rate. Inversely we need to think about how resistant the nodes in the network are to the spreading of this phenomena.  Imagine trying to promote gay mirage in some conservator rural community, no matter how infectious your campaign is it is unlikely to take off and this is due not to your failures but to the resistant of the other nodes in the network to this phenomena.  We could also add time to our model here, capturing how nodes may be affected for only a brief period of time before recovery, As would be the case with the spread of many diseases or some trend in fashion.

As network theory is a very new subject much of it is still focused on trying to explore the basics of static graphs, as the study of their dynamics results in the additional of a whole new sets of parameters to our models and takes us into a new level of complexity, much of which remains unexplored, and is the subject of active research. Transcription excerpt: So lets start by talking about growing a random network to see what it looks like, when we say growing a network we might mean adding more nodes to it, but also, more interestingly adding links to it, that increases the overall connectivity. In our random model links were just placed between nodes at random with some given probability, growing the network here just meant increasing this probability so as to have more links develop over time. One interesting thing we find when we do this is that there are thresholds and phase transitions during the network's development, by thresholds we simply mean that, by gradually increasing our link probability parameter, some property to the network suddenly appearing when we pass a critical value.  So for example our first threshold is when the average degree goes above 1 over the total number of nodes in the network, as at this threshold we start to get our first connection. At degree one that is when every node has on average one connection the network stars to appear connected, we see one giant component  emerging within the network, that is one dominant cluster and we start to have cycles, which means there are feedback loops in the network. Another threshold occurs when nodes have an average degree of log(n) at this point everything starts to be connected meaning there is typically a path to all other nodes in the network. So this is what we see in random network but as we know most real world networks are not random as they are subject to some resource constraints and they have preferential attachment giving them clusters that we do not see in these random graphs. One way of thinking about how real world networks form is through the lens of percolation theory, percolation theory looks at how something filters all percolates through something else like a liquid filtering through some mash structure in a material or we might think about some water running down the side of the hill, as it does the water will find the path of least resistance creating channels and furrows in the side of the hill. This network formation is then the product of the resource constraints that its environment placed upon it, but the constraints are unevenly distributed and the networks topology is then reflecting this as it follows the paths of least resistance as it avoids toughest material. In order to demonstrate the general relevance of this we will take some other examples, if say we put on a cheap flights from one city to another then people will start using that transportation link because of financial constraints. Or because of phenomena of Homophily within social networks we will get the same peculation dynamic where it will be easier for people to make links with people who are similar to themselves than with others, again creating a particular structure based on the social constraints within the system.

As the name implies network theory is all about the study of networks, we are trying to create models so as to analyze them, in order to be able to do this the first thing we need is some kind of formal language and this formal language is called graph theory. We will be going into the details of graph theory in the next lecture but it is a relatively new area of mathematics that gives us some kind of standardized language with which to talk about and quantify the structure and properties of networks. So once we have this basic vocabulary, say you give me a network to analyze the question then turns to what are the features and properties of this network that we should be really interested. The first set of questions we might like to ask relate to individual elements within the network. We want to know what are the nodes within the network what are the connections between them and what properties are we really interested in, for example in a computer network we might not be interested in who owns the different computers and connections but just interested in the speed of the computers and the bandwidth of the connections, so we need to define what it is about our network we are interested in because as with all models we will be focusing on some information and excluding other. There is lots of other information we want to know about these individual elements and the connections, such as asking whether they are weighted or not, meaning can we ascribe a value to them, we can talk about a computer network's bandwidth in megabits per second, but it might not be so easy to do the same with a social network where the relations are of friendship or kinship. We can also ask if these relations go both ways or are just unidirectional. Other questions we will be asking here is how connected is any individual node or how central is it within the overall network. The next major set of questions we will be asking about our network will relate to its overall structure, networks are defined by both what happens on the local level, that is how central or connected you are, but also what happens on the global level, because the dynamics of the network on the global level feeds back to effect the elements on the local level. Here some of the key questions we will be asking about the overall structure to the network is firstly how connected is it? Are there connections between all the parts or are some parts disconnect and separate from others? How dense is this set of connections? If we compare a group of unassociated people waiting at a bus stop with a close knit group of friends we will see the density of the network will vary greatly. What are the patters of clustering within the system? Do we see many small groups or just a few large groups? These are the types of features that will define the overall makeup of the network structure. One key question we are interested in answering here is if we change some parameter to one of                   Show less                   Show more},

  abstract = {In mathematics and computational geometry,  a Delaunay triangulation (also known as a Delone triangulation) for a given set P of discrete points in a general position is a triangulation DT(P) such that no point in P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in DT(P). Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum angle of all the angles of the triangles in the triangulation; they tend to avoid sliver triangles. The triangulation is named after Boris Delaunay for his work on this topic from 1934.For a set of points on the same line there is no Delaunay triangulation (the notion of triangulation is degenerate for this case).  For four or more points on the same circle (e.g., the vertices of a rectangle) the Delaunay triangulation is not unique: each of the two possible triangulations that split the quadrangle into two triangles satisfies the "Delaunay condition", i.e., the requirement that the circumcircles of all triangles have empty interiors. By considering circumscribed spheres, the notion of Delaunay triangulation extends to three and higher dimensions.  Generalizations are possible to metrics other than Euclidean distance. However, in these cases a Delaunay triangulation is not guaranteed to exist or be unique.},
